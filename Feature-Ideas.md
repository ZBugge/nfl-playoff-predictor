- The My Lobbies page should display how many participants are in each lobby
- As a super admin i want to have a dashboard where i can see how many admin accounts have been made/ how many lobbies have been created/ how many users have made predictions etc
- I want to figure out a way to nicely display each user's picks when looking at the lobby. Like clicking their name will then pop up what their bracket looks like
