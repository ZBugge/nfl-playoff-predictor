- As a super admin i want to have a dashboard where i can see how many admin accounts have been made/ how many lobbies have been created/ how many users have made predictions etc
- If the lobby is using the "Both" scoring, display on the leaderboard that weighted score will be used as a tiebreaker
- I want to figure out a way to nicely display each user's picks when looking at the lobby. Like clicking their name will then pop up what their bracket looks like
